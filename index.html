          Hello Everyone! My name is <b>Aryan Bhattarai</b> and I was born and
          raised in <b>Nepal</b> . I completed my schooling from North Point
          English Boarding School and completed my schooling in 2018. After that
          I studied in Dhulabari Secondary School for my +2 and completed in
          2020.

          As for my achievements I havent made that many in studies but I have
          made alot in other activities. I play football and have won many
          medals in this sport. I have played in the
          <b>National League of Nepal</b> for one of the top tier club of Nepal.
          I play guitar aswell and have won some prizes for that.This is all
          that I have for my achievements. Hopefully many more will come in the
          coming future.
        </p>

          I have a goal of becoming a web developer and earn for my living
          working in that job. Aside of my studies I have a ambition of playing
          football for a top tier club of Canada and I will try my best wheather
          I succeed or not. Moreover, I used to play guitar for a local band in
          Nepal and want to form a band in Canada as well. I am just getting
          familiar with Canada and will work hard to live my ambition in
          reality.
